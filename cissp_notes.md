## Modern Cryptography
* Symmetric Key Algorithms
  * Single shared key is used to encrypt and decrypt
  * AKA private key cryptography
  * Provides
    * Confidentiality
  * Advantages
    * Very fast
      * 1000 times faster than asymmetric cryptography
  * Disadvantages
    * Key distribution is hard
      * A secure channel must be established first before key is communicated
    * No non-repudiation mechanism
      * No way to prove an encrypted message came from someone since many people know the key
    * Not scalable
      * Each two-party communication in a large group requires a unique key
    * Frequent key regeneration
      * When someone leaves the group, key needs to be regenerated
* Asymmetric Key Algorithms
  * Private and public key decrypt message encrypted with the other
  * AKA public key algorithms
  * Private key must be kept private by a user
  * Public key must be known by everyone
  * Provides
    * Confidentiality
    * Integrity
    * Authentication
    * Non-repudiation
  * Advantages
    * Key distribution is simple
      * No secure channel required to start communication
    * Supports Non-repudiation mechanism
      * Since only the person knows their private key
      * Allows digital signatures to be generated
        * Hash of a message encrypted with a private key
        * Verification involves decryption using public key and cross-checking hashes
    * Scalable
      * No new key needs to be generated for each pair of communicating parties
      * New users only require generation one key pair
    * Infrequent key regeneration
      * Required only if private key is compromised
      * Key can easily be invalidated when user leaves system
  * Disadvantages

      * 1000 times slower than symmetric cryptography
* Hashing
  * Production of message digest
  * One-way function

## Essential Security Protection Mechanisms
* Technical Mechanisms
  * Layering
    * Levels vs. Rings
      * Layering: Highest layer is most privileged
      * Rings: Lower ring is most privileged
    * Processes in different layers communicate via interfaces
    * Security policy set by higher privileged layers take precedence
  * Abstraction
    * Generalizing a bunch of objects
    * Hiding implementation details
    * Only giving information on interfaces and attributes
    * Allows setting of policies to groups of generalized objects
  * Data Hiding
    * Put objects in different container from subject
    * Ensure that object can only be accessed via a legal way
    * Hide data from processes running at different levels
    * Hide data from those who don't need to know and are unauthorized
  * Process Isolation
    * Each processes have their own memory spaces
    * Processes shouldn't be able to read each other's memory spaces
    * Prvents unauthorized data access
    * Protects integrity of a process as it can't be modified by another process without its consent
    * Implemented via sandboxing processes
  * Hardware Segmentation
    * Process isolation but uses hardware implementations for separation
    * Rare; used for national security concerns
* Policy Mechanisms
  * Least Privilege
    * Only give processes the privileges they need
    * Processes should run in user as much as possible
    * Use APIs to communicate with kernel mode processes instead
  * Separation of Privilege
    * Minimize the number of privileged operations a process can do
    * Basically, principle of least privilege for administrators
    * Compartmentalize reposnibilities of processes
    * Prevents conflict of interest
  * Accountability
    * Record who does what
    * Requires authentication and authorization to associate activity with user
    * Allows users to be held acocuntable for their actions

  * Object verified might be different from the one used
  * TOC - Time of Check
    * Process checks if the object is available and valid
    * Attack replaces object after the program checks it
  * TOU - Time of Use
    * Process then uses the object placed by attacked
  * Example:
    * Process: Check length of file
    * Attacker: Replace file with bigger one
    * Process: Reserves memory as large as the file that was read
    * Process: Leading the actual file into memory causes a buffer overflow
* Technology and Process Integration
  * Systems are being implemented via SOA
  * SOA integrates seperate service applications into a single solution
  * Pay attention to Single Points of Failure
* Electromagnetic Radiation
  * EM leaks create a possible covert channel
  * Faraday Cage
